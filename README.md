# E-Commerce Website Project

This Node.js E-commerce website project incorporates a 3-layer architecture (Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, Presentation Layer) to ensure efficient separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase. Leveraging technologies such as Express.js, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers a seamless and user-friendly online shopping experience.

## Project Highlights

- **Express.js Integration:**
  - Implemented Express.js to create organized routes, efficiently managing endpoints and enhancing overall website functionality.

- **Middleware Implementation:**
  - Integrated middleware for key tasks such as authentication, data validation, error handling, logging, sessions, and cookies to optimize website performance and security.

- **Front-End Technologies:**
  - Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX to design and implement a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Bootstrap and FontAwesome were incorporated for efficient styling and iconography.

- **Database Management:**
  - Leveraged SQL Workbench to implement a robust CRUD system for managing products, orders, and user accounts within the Node.js and Express.js framework.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Implemented comprehensive security measures, including the integration of Google reCAPTCHA to fortify user registration against unauthorized access and spam.

- **SQL Parameterization and Encryption:**
  - Employed SQL parameterization techniques (e.g., using prepared statements) and utilized bcrypt for password hashing to prevent SQL injection attacks and securely store user passwords.

- **Asynchronous Web Interactions:**
  - Implemented asynchronous web interactions using AJAX to enhance the responsiveness of the website.
